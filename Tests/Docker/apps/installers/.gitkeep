# This directory is for application installer scripts
# 
# Installer scripts are run once during container startup, before the startup scripts.
# They should install your applications but not start them.
#
# For Linux:
#   - Create .sh files (e.g., 01-install-myapp.sh)
#   - Make them executable: chmod +x *.sh
#   - Use numbered prefixes to control order (01-, 02-, etc.)
#
# For Windows:
#   - Create .ps1 files (e.g., 01-install-myapp.ps1)
#   - Use numbered prefixes to control order (01-, 02-, etc.)
#
# Example:
#   01-install-puma.sh
#   02-install-lisa.sh
#
# See ../README.md for detailed examples
