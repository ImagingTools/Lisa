# This directory is for application startup scripts
#
# Startup scripts are run during container startup, after installers.
# They should start your applications and wait for them to be ready.
#
# For Linux:
#   - Create .sh files (e.g., 01-start-myapp.sh)
#   - Make them executable: chmod +x *.sh
#   - Use numbered prefixes to control order (01-, 02-, etc.)
#   - Include health checks to ensure services are ready
#
# For Windows:
#   - Create .ps1 files (e.g., 01-start-myapp.ps1)
#   - Use numbered prefixes to control order (01-, 02-, etc.)
#   - Include health checks to ensure services are ready
#
# Example:
#   01-start-puma.sh
#   02-start-lisa.sh
#
# See ../README.md for detailed examples
